# QuestfortheMadBomber

Here is the very first game I sold to a Commodore 64 magazine in 1995 called Quest for the Mad Bomber. I made $350, which averaged to a two week paycheck in those days.

The game is found in the D64 file 136SIDE.D64 (Side 3 of LoadStar). Just type LOAD "*",8,1 and you will see it. Enjoy!
